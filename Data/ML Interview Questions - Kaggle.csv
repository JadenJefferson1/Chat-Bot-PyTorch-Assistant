What is Machine learning?,Machine learning is a branch of computer science which deals with system programming to automatically learn and improve with experience. Robots are programmed so that they can perform the task based on data they gather from sensors.
Mention the difference between Data Mining and Machine learning?,"Machine learning relates to the study, design, and development of algorithms that give computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Data mining is the process where unstructured data is analyzed to extract knowledge or patterns."
What is Overfitting in Machine learning?,Overfitting occurs when a model describes random error or noise instead of the underlying relationship. This is usually due to the model being overly complex with too many parameters.
Why does overfitting happen?,Overfitting happens because the criteria used for training the model is not the same as that used to judge the model's effectiveness.
How can you avoid overfitting?,"Overfitting can be avoided by using a large dataset, cross-validation, data augmentation, regularization, reducing the number of features, or simplifying the model structure."
What is inductive machine learning?,"Inductive machine learning involves the process of learning by examples, where a system induces a general rule from a set of observed instances."
What are the five popular algorithms of Machine Learning?,"The five popular algorithms are Decision Trees, Neural Networks (backpropagation), Probabilistic networks, Nearest Neighbor, and Support Vector Machines."
What are the different Algorithm techniques in Machine Learning?,"The different types of techniques in Machine Learning are Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Semi-supervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Transduction, Learning to Learn."

What is Model Selection in Machine Learning?,Model selection is the process of selecting the best model from a set of mathematical models used to describe the same data set.
What are the two methods used for the calibration in Supervised Learning?,The two methods used for calibration are Platt Calibration and Isotonic Regression.
Which method is frequently used to prevent overfitting?,Isotonic Regression is used when there is sufficient data to prevent overfitting.
What is the difference between heuristic for rule learning and heuristics for decision trees?,"Heuristics for decision trees evaluate the average quality of many disjointed sets, while rule learners evaluate the quality of the set covered by the candidate rule."
What is Perceptron in Machine Learning?,Perceptron is an algorithm for supervised classification of input into one of several possible non-binary outputs.
Explain the two components of the Bayesian logic program?,A Bayesian logic program consists of two components: a logical one (Bayesian Clauses) and a quantitative one that encodes domain information.
What are Bayesian Networks (BN)?,Bayesian networks are graphical models that represent probabilistic relationships among variables.
Why instance-based learning algorithm sometimes referred to as a Lazy learning algorithm?,An instance-based learning algorithm is also referred to as lazy learning because it delays the induction or generalization process until classification is performed.
What are the two classification methods that SVM (Support Vector Machine) can handle?,The two classification methods SVM can handle are combining binary classifiers and modifying binary classifiers to incorporate multiclass learning.
What is ensemble learning?,Ensemble learning involves combining multiple models to solve a particular computational problem.
Why is ensemble learning used?,"Ensemble learning is used to improve classification, prediction, or function approximation."
